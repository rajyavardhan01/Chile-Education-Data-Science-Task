# Chile-Education-Data-Science-Task

As part of a broad analysis of the market for higher education in Chile, Professors Hastings, Neilson and Zimmerman worked in conjunction with the Chilean Ministry of Education to administer a survey to federal student loan applicants. The survey consisted of six main questions which asked for the applicant’s top three enrollment choices, certainty of application plans, expectations about earnings on completion of each degree, expectations about degree costs, and expected performance on college entrance examinations.

Upon Completion of the survey, randomly selected students were given the option to search a database for degrees with higher earnings net of costs for past graduates. The database allowed students to select a major and enter an entrance exam score. Based on that information, the page populated a table of degrees admitting students with similar scores sorted by net value.
Task:

The file edu_chile_survey_output.csv contains the raw responses to survey questions among those applicants allowed to search the database, as well as applicant demographic data and database search history. Using this file:

    To organize the raw file into a relational database. Please provide a schematic or equivalent form of high level overview outlining the     logical organization of tables in your database.
    
    To develop and train a model to predict whether an applicant will use the searchable database. Please provide a brief writeup outlining your methodology and discussing any aspects of your results you find interesting or policy relevant.
